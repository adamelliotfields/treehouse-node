### About this Workshop
Have you ever wondered how you add social login to your Express.js websites? They all use a protocol called OAuth, and there's an npm module called Passport.js that helps you integrate it in to your Node.js application.

### Notes
To see the ES2015 React version using basic auth and Bcrypt, check out my other [project](https://github.com/adamelliotfields/treehouse-node/tree/master/user-authentication-with-express-and-mongo).

# About This Course
Learn how to implement a custom user authentication system that controls users access to web resources using Node.js using Express and MongoDB. The system lets users sign up, log in, and log out, limiting access to password-protected resources. Express is a popular web framework for creating MVC applications and RESTful APIs in Node.js. Express lets developers define routes and middleware for submitting and retrieving data in our database. We will leverage the document based NoSQL database, MongoDB, to store our user data by creating a user model with mongoose. Mongoose is an open source Node package for defining data models for an application and connecting to MongoDB.
